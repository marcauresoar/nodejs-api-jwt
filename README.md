# NodeJS API with JWT authentication

This repository contains a very simple example of a NodeJs API with Register and Login functions, using JWT to authenticate the user.

I created it following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jqok-WgelI

## Pre-requisites

Please, make sure you have the following software installed in your machine:
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Postman (optional)

## How to run

Go to the project directory and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

It will install all of the project dependencies. After that, you can start the server by running:

```
npm start
```

If everything goes well, you'll be able to see a message **Server Up and running** in the console.

In order to test the application, there's a directory called `postman-collection` that contains a collection of endpoints to hit. You can import the collection in your Postman.
